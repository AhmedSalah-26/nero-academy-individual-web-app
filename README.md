## Requirements

- Flutter SDK with Dart `^3.5.0`
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter tooling
- Android SDK for Android builds
- Xcode for iOS builds on macOS
- A configured Supabase project
- Paymob merchant credentials if payment flows are enabled

## Getting Started

1. Install packages.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Confirm backend configuration.

Supabase configuration is currently defined in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`. Paymob configuration is currently defined in `lib/core/config/paymob_config.dart`.

For production, move private payment credentials and environment-specific values out of source code and load them through a secure configuration process.

3. Prepare the database.

Apply the SQL scripts in `database_scripts/` to your Supabase database in the intended order for your environment. The later numbered scripts contain fixes and feature additions.

4. Run the app.

```bash
flutter run
```

Run a specific target when needed:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d android
```

## Common Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build web --release
```

Regenerate native splash and launcher icons after changing assets:

```bash
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Localization

The app uses EasyLocalization with Arabic as the fallback and start locale. Translation files live in:

- `assets/translations/ar.json`
- `assets/translations/en.json`

The main app switches text direction automatically:

- Arabic uses RTL.
- English uses LTR.

## Routing

Navigation is centralized in `lib/core/routing/app_router.dart` with GoRouter. Main areas include:

- `/splash`
- `/login`
- `/home`
- `/instructors`
- `/my-learning`
- `/forums-tab`
- `/profile`
- `/parent_entrance`
- `/parent_dashboard`

Feature screens add their own routes for details, checkout, dashboards, quizzes, reports, and editor flows.

## Backend Notes

- Supabase initialization happens during app startup in `lib/main.dart`.
- Data access is organized by feature using data sources, repositories, use cases, cubits, and presentation screens.
- Supabase Edge Functions are stored in `supabase/functions/`.
- SQL setup and repair scripts are stored in `database_scripts/`.
- Storage buckets referenced by the app include avatars, courses, and certificates.

## Payment Notes

Paymob is initialized only when credentials are configured. The app includes support for:

- Card payments
- Wallet payments
- Payment web views
- Payment success handling
- Payment history
- Refund and payout related database scripts

Keep production credentials outside version control.

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
flutter test
```

Run static analysis:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

Current tests include shared widget coverage and feature-specific tests under `test/`.

## Build Outputs

Use Flutter build commands for each target:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build web --release
flutter build windows --release
```

The generated build folders are not source files and should not be committed unless a release workflow explicitly requires artifacts.

## Notes for Maintainers

- Keep feature logic inside `lib/features/<feature_name>/`.
- Put reusable UI, services, routing, theme, constants, and error handling in `lib/core/`.
- Prefer existing shared widgets before creating new UI primitives.
- Keep Arabic and English translation keys in sync.
- Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before release builds.
